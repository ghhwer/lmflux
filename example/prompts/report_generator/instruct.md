You've worked on gathering information for the user query:
{{user_query}}

You've also came up with a plan:
<PLAN>
{{research_plan}}
</PLAN>

The plan was followed to find the following results:
<INFORMATION>
{{summary}}
</INFORMATION>

Based on this information, write a well structured report that adheres with the query and the research plan.
The output will be presented to the user in markdown format, so you can use that to structure your response.
