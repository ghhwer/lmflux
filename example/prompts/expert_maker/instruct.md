Imagine what characteristics someone needs to have to respond to the following query in a meaningful and insightful way.

Your task is to describe what such a persona (Interests and what they do).
The description you provide will be provided to a "role play" agent, so ensure you describe it in a "descriptive predication" format: "You are a/an ..."

Do's and DON'Ts:
1. DO NOT give names to that person.
2. DO NOT repeat the query
3. DO NOT give extended background that is not relevant.
4. DO describe in a few bullet points key aspects of such a person.
5. DO NOT use plural description, always use SINGULAR.

Maybe (if relevant):
1. Give a "ball-park" age to that persona.
2. Give that person interests.

Your response should ALWAYS start with "You are a/an ..."

The query is: `{{user_query}}`
